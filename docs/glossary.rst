    assay
        A collection of samples measured in experimental conditions.

    data matrix
        A table containing extracted data from chemical species in wide format, i.e., each
        row of the matrix is associated with a sample and each column is associated with
        a feature group

    envelope
        A collection of isotopologues features.

    EIC
        Extracted Ion Chromatograms

    feature
        A ROI subregion associated with a chemical species in a sample

    feature descriptor
        A numeric property that describes a feature. For example, peak area or peak width.

    feature group
        A collection of features detected in different samples associated to the same chemical
        identity using a feature matching algorithm.

    LC-MS
        Liquid Chromatography coupled to Mass spectrometry.

    m/z
        Mass to charge ratio

    ROI
        Region of Interest. A region extracted from a raw data file which may contain features.

    sample
        And individual experimental measurement
        
    SNR
        signal-to-noise ratio
