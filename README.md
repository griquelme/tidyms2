TidyMS2
=======

Tools to process mass spectrometry data.

TidyMS2 is an upgraded version from [TidyMS](https://github.com/griquelme/tidyms), built from scratch and designed
to work with Python latest practices.

TidyMS offers a highly customizable framework for processing mass spectrometry datasets:

**For processing MS datasets:**

- tools for processing LC-MS datasets: build pipelines to define how to process your data and TidyMS manages the rest.
- utilities for working with chemical entities: formulas, formulas generators and formula scorers.
- test your pipelines with dataset simulation utilities
- data persistence for intermediate data and results 
- result visualization

**For creating new processing algorithms**

- a highly extensive data model for expressing features
- a data flow model that validates and manages data through your data pipeline.
